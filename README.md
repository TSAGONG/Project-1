# PROJECT 1 : SNAKE GAME 

 A one player 2D game intended to challenge the user. There is only one level; therefore,
 the speed is faster than what one would expect from the first level. Enjoy and get the 
 highest score possibe.

These were my early ideas in terms of how I wanted to approach making my game.
Eventually, as I worked on my game I knew i would need more time to complete my ideas.
Therefore, I only have one level instead of having a player advance to higher and more difficult levels after a player eats a certain amount of food. Due to this, I made sure to not make the game super easy so that people can be challenged and get the highest score possible.
